# NOVAM #

Novam is a tool to display information about UK bus stops in [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org/). 

It was developed to help with the import of the [NaPTAN](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/NaPTAN) data. 
The tool displays bus stops in different colours on a map to help spotting unverified bus stops from the 
NaPTAN import and bus stops which are not correctly tagged.

More information can be found in the [OpenstStreetMap Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/NaPTAN/Novam).

The live version of NOVAM is available at **http://b3e.net/novam/**.
